The idea is that the platform will also serve as a deposit point for users to contribute their responses for the next issue of the publication (which would offer a different &#39;would you rather&#39; scenario). The publication will draw from the Vox Pop concept-short for the Latin, &#39;Vox Populi&#39;- meaning, &quot;voice of the people&quot;. A Vox Pop seeks to gauge public opinion on a single, central question. The question could be connected to anything—whether it&#39;s something in the news, something silly, or something reflective. </p><div class="text-container" data-v-4b77ae3b><h2 class="text" data-v-4b77ae3b>Underpinning Message</h2></div><p data-v-4b77ae3b> The publication emphasises collective knowledge-building by creating a shared &quot;library of perspectives&quot;. Each contribution to the publication adds to the understanding of a central question. Then, by hearing varied responses, users will be encouraged to be introspective, reflecting on their own views and others&#39; views. In this way, &quot;Would you rather…?&quot; scenarios will be tools for self-reflection and bridge a connection with a broader audience, leading to ideas and insights that wouldn&#39;t arise alone. </p><p data-v-4b77ae3b> Each question, whether light-hearted or profound, is designed to let people reconsider their underlying values and perspectives, which are often influenced by cultural or social factors that we are sometimes not aware of. Users can explore their perspectives, with challenges to their existing perspectives, in a safe, anonymous and communal setting. </p><p data-v-4b77ae3b> Essentially, this platform is a way to &quot;hear&quot; diverse voices and learn from lived experiences. This helps with understanding our social world by allowing users to explore ideas outside their comfort zone. Each response can reveal new ways of framing the world that users wouldn&#39;t encounter in their own daily life, encouraging empathy in an increasingly divided online world. </p><p data-v-4b77ae3b> Listening to others&#39; perspectives not only sparks personal growth but also encourages users to examine the social influences shaping their beliefs. One user found the poll helped them reflect on how they exercise their own privilege through assumptions made in daily life - i.e. access to quality healthcare, and the ability to spend leisure time and disconnect from work. The audience will see that by contributing, they&#39;re taking an active role in co-creating a unique community dialogue. They become part of a developing conversation, that reflects the collective consciousness of the group. </p></section><section data-v-4b77ae3b><div class="text-container" data-v-4b77ae3b><h1 class="text" data-v-4b77ae3b>TARGET AUDIENCE</h1></div><p data-v-4b77ae3b>This publication will appeal to a range of audience characteristics and preferences.</p><p data-v-4b77ae3b> Philosophical thinkers and conversationalists enjoy hypothetical questions, thought experiments, and moral dilemmas. They value deep questions that encourage self-reflection, explore different perspectives, and delve into the mechanics of knowledge generation. </p><p data-v-4b77ae3b> In contrast, pop culture fans engage with &quot;Would you rather…?&quot; scenarios tied to current events or celebrity culture, finding fun and relevance in these timely references. </p><p data-v-4b77ae3b> Nostalgia seekers are drawn to questions that evoke personal memories and stories, particularly those that tap into nostalgia or reflect on personal growth. </p><p data-v-4b77ae3b> Active podcast listeners, from a media consumption standpoint, are a key group. These consumers enjoy short-form audio content in series or conversational formats. They are drawn to micro-interviews that offer a cross-section of others&#39; lives. </p><p data-v-4b77ae3b> Users who are actively engaged with social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, or Twitter, who are motivated to contribute content or respond to others. </p><p data-v-4b77ae3b> People with busy lifestyles prefer bite-sized content they can consume on the go. Micro-interviews and short scenarios fit easily into their lives and could be drawn to these platforms because they are a light-hearted break from their routines. </p><p data-v-4b77ae3b> People who enjoy being part of a community and are motivated, for a variety of reasons, to engage with and connect to, other users. Being part of an active, community dialogue is a powerful motivator. They are driven by hearing others&#39; thoughts, understanding shared opinions, and connecting through mutual experiences. </p><p data-v-4b77ae3b> The publication will also appeal to users who are motivated to express their own personal beliefs and views. </p><p data-v-4b77ae3b> Lastly, curious, open-minded users who are interested in others&#39; perspectives. They value hearing opinions they might not encounter or even agree within their everyday lives. They seek personal growth and wisdom by exploring other perspectives on both light-hearted and profound questions. </p></section><section data-v-4b77ae3b><div class="text-container" data-v-4b77ae3b><h1 class="text" data-v-4b77ae3b>STYLISTIC APPROACH</h1></div><div class="text-container" data-v-4b77ae3b><h2 class="text" data-v-4b77ae3b>Moodboard</h2></div><div class="img-container" data-v-4b77ae3b><div class="photo-gallery" data-v-4b77ae3b><div class="column" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/47/e3/61/47e361211751c349d12862c03ee208b4.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/41/14/6f/41146f7abac4c6182891d4018a9382b6.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/a6/5c/04/a65c04dddd3bcb2a61c7fdffcd31c09f.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/38/2a/66/382a6686921e2179aac31bf0d523c23b.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/8b/b7/1a/8bb71ab1554015fb73f897359ba5062e.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b></div><div class="column" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/d9/8f/4d/d98f4dbcb3439867001785f9731e784b.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/1f/6c/fe/1f6cfe959ea3e6d02d0d9ae327878092.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/53/20/c3/5320c3116727d66333c1191328486981.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ed/9d/56/ed9d5682a12213e71a62eb7b7901df22.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b></div><div class="column" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/70/8b/3b/708b3b3151ca06e80a900736462bb2cb.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/b0/f6/5b/b0f65ba00c9e8fc4a648843162a7a928.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/d4/e5/2a/d4e52af0e4d7b59bd5c1f759ae7527ba.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/2f/00/99/2f0099ce0f1bb049aeb18dd4c3b5b4c8.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/1e/3b/11/1e3b115ec8e3e4feb0a0b994da4ad446.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b></div><div class="column" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/4c/a8/1b/4ca81b8d35e7a4f5b64dd37acfc60ef1.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c8/92/af/c892afcec56f0d39b4e5824838b46d35.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/d3/74/38/d3743863ff0454a6cf03dd89b5aa334e.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/cb/15/9f/cb159fdc3e34709349e446aa106c8dd9.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/c6/ca/98/c6ca98ff0a317777d5fede6e341d40ad.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b></div><div class="column" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/f1/73/4d/f1734dc5627170484c55d24818657d61.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/79/0c/30/790c3029a91847b60ec190ce6a7e61ac.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/95/bc/92/95bc92deb7f464cecb29f2e582dfcaca.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/5e/df/d7/5edfd76d3c8541c2004e4efdbdfb2428.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/4b/a1/d2/4ba1d2cfa049412627ce38a9ae421b60.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/32/6e/15/326e15d933fb2d30bbc50ba66c008d63.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b></div><div class="column" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/bf/f7/a7/bff7a7a91878db80279590988311fdeb.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/55/e9/28/55e9285a54c0d1112cd5e7e3dc6a4bad.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/de/62/05/de62054da6cc0fbd081c4b59b6a722f6.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/86/2a/d7/862ad7c223fbbead2d7c982d3bc67504.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/8e/b4/c7/8eb4c7d5eb55b9550c8893729184f965.jpg" alt="moodboard" data-v-4b77ae3b></div></div></div><p data-v-4b77ae3b> Through the use of nostalgia, the website&#39;s aesthetic reflects an early form of the internet, where websites were far more unique, personal and introspective. </p><p data-v-4b77ae3b> Incorporating signature elements of early websites reflects a big part of the identity of the publication.

This would involve using a backend server and keeping voice recordings of users. This poses a risk in terms of security and privacy. This has been visually represented as a page on the website. </p></section><section data-v-4b77ae3b><div class="text-container" data-v-4b77ae3b><h1 class="text" data-v-4b77ae3b>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</h1></div><div class="text-container" data-v-4b77ae3b><h2 class="text" data-v-4b77ae3b>Big Picture &amp; Evolution</h2></div><p data-v-4b77ae3b> The plan is to have monthly editions so there is enough time for users to reflect, contribute and engage with the publication. A month will be enough time to get enough submissions. It will evolve and improve over time and adjustments can be made, for example, the time between editions can be shortened or made longer with relatively easily. </p><div class="text-container" data-v-4b77ae3b><h2 class="text" data-v-4b77ae3b>Physical release</h2></div><div data-v-4b77ae3b><h3 class="text-container" data-v-4b77ae3b>Physical Release &amp; Expanding Reach</h3></div><p data-v-4b77ae3b> Tellus could potentially expand its reach by utilising various social media platforms. One idea might involve filming bite-sized interviews in strange places incongruent with the topic—for instance, talking about Wall Street beside a waterfall—to create visual and thematic contrast. Another possibility could be organising pop-up street interviews, although this would require further consideration to ensure it aligns with the publication&#39;s philosophy. </p><div data-v-4b77ae3b><h3 class="text-container" data-v-4b77ae3b>Interactive App or Periodic Updates</h3></div><p data-v-4b77ae3b> In the future, the publication could evolve into an app. This could encourage users to engage with friends and the wider online community, fostering continuous dialogue. This format might become a fun and interactive way for people to stay connected. </p><div data-v-4b77ae3b><h3 class="text-container" data-v-4b77ae3b>Artistic Exhibitions &amp; Community Responses</h3></div><p data-v-4b77ae3b> Going full circle back to the initial concept of Tellus in Finland, the project could potentially be extended into physical exhibitions, showcasing community responses to specific questions. Artists could create pieces inspired by these responses, providing visitors with an immersive and reflective experience. Visitors could also contribute by recording or writing their answers on-site, gradually transforming the exhibition space, illustrating the evolving dialogue. </p><div data-v-4b77ae3b><h3 class="text-container" data-v-4b77ae3b>Creative AI Integration</h3></div><p data-v-4b77ae3b> In the future, the project might explore the use of AI to add a playful and experimental dimension. An AI trained on the archive of user responses could generate humorous or unexpected outputs, such as quirky &quot;Would you rather?&quot; scenarios or creative interpretations of user input. This could provide both entertainment and an interesting commentary on how AI interacts with human creativity. </p></section><section data-v-4b77ae3b><div class="text-container" data-v-4b77ae3b><h1 class="text" data-v-4b77ae3b>ETHICAL &amp; LEGAL OBLIGATIONS</h1></div><p data-v-4b77ae3b> The publication will need to be moderated to avoid potential issues arising with submissions from anonymous users. One way to mitigate this would be to have a traditional sign-up method where a user is prompted to input: First/Last name, e-mail (verification), username and location. This will only be available to the moderators. </p><p data-v-4b77ae3b> There are no age restrictions and no third-party data collection. Community guidelines will be included that stress the importance of abiding by respectful content that is non-political and relevant. </p><p data-v-4b77ae3b> The other legal and ethical obligation is to abide by copyright legislation. Ethically, it is inauthentic to use other&#39;s material without referencing, but by definition, this publication encourages and prompts self-reflection and personal perspectives. This provides some protection from copyright issues, but moderating the content is also a way to screen for breaches of copyright. </p><div class="text-container" data-v-4b77ae3b><h2 class="text" data-v-4b77ae3b>Acknowledging Indigenous Culture</h2></div><p data-v-4b77ae3b> These values are important when considering the indigenous people and Australian culture. There is a responsibility to acknowledge the traditional custodians and respect the traditional owners of this land. The question &quot;Would you rather…?&quot; is inclusive but one of the responsibilities of the moderation process would be to ensure that the content is respectful. </p></section><section data-v-4b77ae3b><div class="text-container" data-v-4b77ae3b><h1 class="text" data-v-4b77ae3b>PROJECT VIABILITY</h1></div><div class="text-container" data-v-4b77ae3b><h2 class="text" data-v-4b77ae3b>Skills &amp; Resources</h2></div><p data-v-4b77ae3b> A few resources are needed to develop the publication further. Firstly, access to a laptop, computer and software such as Visual Studio Code, GitHub and open-source software as well as access to community and public resources such as the library and academic institutions. This will support the future development and evolution of Tellus. </p><p data-v-4b77ae3b> Technical skills are needed for this publication to succeed. Competence and agility in software skills are key and an interest in developing these further provide the scaffolding on which other skills rely. </p><p data-v-4b77ae3b> An innate curiosity about people and a personal interest in exploring others&#39; perspectives on a range of issues comes from intrinsic motivation. This enthusiasm for the publication is an essential skill required to stay motivated if/when there are challenges or roadblocks in any stage of the publication. </p><p data-v-4b77ae3b> These skills and resources will enhance the ability to continue developing the publication and expand to more platforms. There is no interest in exploring this publication for financial gain or personal recognition and this will help protect the ethical and legal boundaries of Tellus. </p><div class="text-container" data-v-4b77ae3b><h2 class="text" data-v-4b77ae3b>Funding &amp; Sponsorships</h2></div><p data-v-4b77ae3b> Funding, sponsorships and collaborations could be arranged with institutions who are working to increase their online engagement. Institutions in Canberra like the Canberra Innovation Network could be an excellent choice to evolve this publication with funding. </p><div class="text-container" data-v-4b77ae3b><h2 class="text" data-v-4b77ae3b>Collaborations</h2></div><p data-v-4b77ae3b> Tellus is a flexible product allowing a safe and engaging way for a relevant target audience to stay engaged. Potential collaborations are with museums/galleries and within learning institutions such as schools or universities. Tellus could be a useful asset allowing a museum/gallery to enhance their audience reach by promoting their exhibitions. By asking content related &quot;Would You Rathers?&quot; audience interest can be focussed on a specific exhibition or on the museum/gallery overall, increasing their ability to stay engaged with or expand their customer base and stay viable. </p><p data-v-4b77ae3b> Teachers/educators could request curriculum-relevant questions and use Tellus as a launch pad for class discussions, stimulating discussion, enhancing respect for diverse opinion and enhancing learning in a safe environment. </p></section><section data-v-4b77ae3b><div class="text-container" data-v-4b77ae3b><h1 class="text" data-v-4b77ae3b>RESOURCES &amp; REFERENCES</h1></div><div class="text-container" data-v-4b77ae3b><h2 class="text" data-v-4b77ae3b>Research references</h2></div><ul data-v-4b77ae3b><li data-v-4b77ae3b><a href="https://www.kqed.org/education/vox-pop-curriculum" data-v-4b77ae3b>vox pop curriculum</a></li><li data-v-4b77ae3b><a href="https://voxpops.com/news/what-is-a-vox-pop/" data-v-4b77ae3b>what is a vox pop?</a></li><li data-v-4b77ae3b><a href="https://www.act.gov.au/business/get-help-and-advice/canberra-innovation-network-cbrin" data-v-4b77ae3b>cbrin help &amp; advice</a></li><li data-v-4b77ae3b><a href="https://willyoupressthebutton.com/" data-v-4b77ae3b>will you press the button?</a></li><li data-v-4b77ae3b><a href="https://au.pinterest.com/maxestwell/tellus-website/" data-v-4b77ae3b>Moodboard</a></li></ul><div class="text-container" data-v-4b77ae3b><h2 class="text" data-v-4b77ae3b>Development resources</h2></div><ul data-v-4b77ae3b><li data-v-4b77ae3b><a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/live/what-is-live/" data-v-4b77ae3b>Ableton Live</a></li><li data-v-4b77ae3b><a href="https://chatgpt.com" data-v-4b77ae3b>ChatGPT</a></li></ul><div class="text-container" data-v-4b77ae3b><h3 class="text" data-v-4b77ae3b>Stock photos</h3></div><ul class="last" data-v-4b77ae3b><li data-v-4b77ae3b><a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/realistic-rave-sticker-design_42113467.htm#fromView=search&amp;page=1&amp;position=33&amp;uuid=8a95c452-3ecc-473e-aae3-03a8ee74a84a" data-v-4b77ae3b> sticker illustration </a></li><li data-v-4b77ae3b><a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/set-circular-page-curl-sticker-template-design_361061246.htm#fromView=search&amp;page=1&amp;position=21&amp;uuid=f5408efe-8594-4f33-b774-aa5ef428e0af" data-v-4b77ae3b> sticker </a></li><li data-v-4b77ae3b><a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/human-hands-set_956071.htm#fromView=search&amp;page=1&amp;position=11&amp;uuid=f513a4df-5c28-4089-8cb4-7e276b6037aa" data-v-4b77ae3b> hand </a></li><li data-v-4b77ae3b><a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/hand-drawn-foot-cartoon-illustration_172782095.htm#fromView=search&amp;page=1&amp;position=20&amp;uuid=46b34b51-ebf3-48a4-bcf9-6acf6471c5ab" data-v-4b77ae3b> foot </a></li></ul></section></div>',1))],64))}},g=o(p,[["__scopeId","data-v-4b77ae3b"]]);export{g as default};
