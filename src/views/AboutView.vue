        <h1>What is Tellus?</h1>
        <p>
          Tellus began as an idea pitched by a University of Canberra academic during a study tour
          in Finland as part of a group university project.
        </p>

        <p>
          It evolved into a curated audio archive of micro-interviews based on the 'Would you
          ratherâ€¦?' concept, blending creativity and public engagement. The platform invites users
          to share their own responses for future editions, drawing on the Vox Pop tradition to
          explore a mix of thought-provoking, lighthearted, and reflective questions.
